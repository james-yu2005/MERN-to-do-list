## MERN To-Do List

This project is a simple **To-Do List** application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks while providing basic functionality to manage their to-do list.

### Key Features:
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks with simple ui.
- **Backend API**: Developed the backend using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle CRUD operations.
- **Database**: Used **MongoDB** to store task data.
- **Frontend**: Built with **React.js** to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
- **Real-time Updates**: Tasks are updated in real-time on the frontend with the help of state management.

### How It Works:
1. The backend is responsible for handling API requests related to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
2. The **MongoDB** database stores the tasks and interacts with the server through **Mongoose**.
3. **React.js** handles the frontend and communicates with the backend using **Axios** for making API requests.
4. Users can manage their to-do tasks with a responsive and easy-to-use interface.

### Tools & Technologies:
- **MongoDB**: For storing task data.
- **Express.js**: For building the API and managing backend routes.
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for handling requests.
- **React.js**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
